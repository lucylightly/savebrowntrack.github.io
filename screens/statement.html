					On Thursday May 28th ​at 12:00pm, hundreds of unsuspecting varsity athletes received a Zoom meeting invitation from Brown’s Director of Athletics. The video began at 1:03pm, and by 1:07pm eleven varsity sports were officially
					terminated. One of these teams is the 145-year-old Men’s cross country and track & field program. These teams were replaced by men and women’s club sailing. This decision, titled the “​excellence initiative​,” was made in hopes of
					increasing the “competitiveness” and “diversity” of all teams on campus.

					Track and field is arguably the most financially accessible sport. It allows low-income students and POC to pursue higher education opportunities that they may not have had access to otherwise. One of the sports that has replaced
					track and field at Brown’s varsity level is sailing, which is extremely financially restrictive and a predominantly white sport. Despite Brown’s $4.2 billion endowment, this decision was strategically announced after the freshman
					matriculation deadline, as well as the transfer deadline, had passed. This intentional decision ensures that Brown will continue to receive tuition from as many students as possible, unless they choose to take a semester away from
					school.
					<br></br>
					The university claims that this change will increase the “competitiveness” of Brown's athletics as a whole. However, throughout the past decade, the T&F/XC programs have consistently produced Ivy League Champions, all-time Ivy
					League record holders, NCAA All-Americans, and Olympians. Less than a month ago, Brown named 20 outstanding senior athletes who have made significant contributions to their sport, and university alike, in the past four years. Of
					the 36 varsity athletic programs on campus, 20% of these awards were given to track and field athletes, demonstrating how the elimination of our program would be detrimental to Brown's competitiveness.
					<br></br>
					Additionally, coaches, athletes, nor alumni were aware of this ​initiative​. Rather, the heartbreaking news was delivered to us over a 10-minute zoom call. We were left heartbroken and stunned. Men and women in this sport work as
					a team, genders in unison. This team trains together, eats together, travels together, and lives together. Men and women in this sport are truly equal, they are co-captains, training partners, and family. Brown University's
					analysis, assessments, stats, and donor dollars will never tell the complete story of Brown's track and field team. It has drastically overlooked one of its most culturally and socio-economically diverse teams.
					<br></br>
					We are asking anyone sympathetic to this decision to support the men's track and field program in our fight. Please:
					<br />
					1. Sign our ​petition
					<br />
					2. Share our message on social media using the hashtag, #SaveBrownTrack
					<br />
					3. Keep an eye out for future updates
